Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
; Sets the interval during which starts are limited with StartLimitBurst.
StartLimitIntervalSec=60
; No more than this number of restarts will happen per StartLimitInterval.

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/run/syslog-lite

ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

; Run slightly below interactive priority

; Handle exit cases using always, on-success, on-failure, on-abnormal, on-abort, or on-watchdog.
Restart=on-failure

; User and group the process will run as.
User=syslog
Group=adm

; Local configuration will be read from this directory.
; The text file should contain new-line-separated variable assignments.

; The following additional security directives further retrict privileges that can be gained by the service.
; Note that you may have to add capabilities required by any plugins in use.

;AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

; Limit the number of file descriptors; see `man systemd.exec` for more limit settings.
;LimitNOFILE=1048576
; Unmodified app is not expected to use more than that.
;LimitNPROC=64

; Use private /tmp and /var/tmp, which are discarded after app stops.
;PrivateTmp=true

; Use a minimal /dev
;PrivateDevices=true

; Prevent alteration of /home, /root, and /run/user.
;ProtectHome=read-only

; Make /usr, /boot, /etc and possibly some more folders read-only.
;ProtectSystem=full

; Make kernel variables in /proc read-only (newer systemd versions only).
;ProtectKernelTunables=true

; Disable module loading (newer systemd versions only).
;ProtectKernelModules=true

; Make Linux control groups read-only (newer systemd versions only).
;ProtectControlGroups=true

; â€¦ exceptions that still remain writable
;   This merely retains r/w access rights, it does not add any new. Must still be writable on the host!

; Ensures that the service process and all its children can never gain new privileges
; (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or filesystem capabilities).
